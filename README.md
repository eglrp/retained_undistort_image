The implementation is done using `cv::initUndistortRectifyMap` and `cv::getOptimalNewCameraMatrix`.<br>

## Implementation
The code is implemented using MS Visual Studio 2012. All the code is in `main.cpp`. Using Visual Studio as the IDE, this requires some [project setting](https://github.com/stanathong/retained_undistort_image/blob/master/project_setting.md).
